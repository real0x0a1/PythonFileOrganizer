# File Organizer

This is a simple Python script that allows you to organize files in a source directory based on their file extension and creation date. The organized files will be moved to a specified destination directory.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/real0x0a1/PythonFileOrganizer.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PythonFileOrganizer
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 PythonFileOrganizer.py
   ```

2. Enter the source directory path when prompted.

3. Enter the destination directory path when prompted.

4. The script will iterate through the files in the source directory, create directories based on file extension and creation date in the destination directory, and move the files accordingly.

5. Once the process is completed, a message will be displayed.

## Example

Source directory: `/path/to/source_dir`

Destination directory: `/path/to/destination_dir`

```bash
Enter the source directory path: /path/to/source_dir
Enter the destination directory path: /path/to/destination_dir
File organization completed.
```

The files in the source directory will be organized and moved to the destination directory based on their file extension and creation date.
